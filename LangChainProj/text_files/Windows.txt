Peace be upon you. Today, we’re going to set up Windows Server 2019. The first thing we need to download is, of course, the ISO file. We’ll search for "Windows Server 2019 download" and select the link from Microsoft. Then we’ll choose "English (United States)," ISO download, and 64-bit edition. Once you click, the download will start. I already have it downloaded. We’ll use VirtualBox, which you can also download by searching for "VirtualBox download" and selecting the Windows version. Clicking will begin the download as well, and I’ve already installed it.
Now, let’s start creating a new machine. We’ll go to Machine > New and name it "Windows Server 2019" or whatever you like. Select the path where you want to save it. Then, choose the ISO file, Microsoft Windows, and Windows 2019 64-bit. Next, let’s allocate 4GB of RAM initially (we can reduce it to 2GB after installation), two CPUs, and 10GB of disk space. After reviewing the settings, we’ll click "Finish."
Now, we’ll go into the settings before starting. Go to Storage and add the ISO. You can set the network to "Host-only adapter." Everything seems ready, so let’s start the machine.
The installation begins, and we’ll select the language, time, and keyboard layout (default is English). Click Next and Install Now. You’ll see about four options: Standard, which gives you a command-line interface, or Desktop Experience, which we’ll choose since it’s easier.
After accepting the license and choosing custom installation, we’ll format the disk and start the installation. I’ll pause the video until it’s finished. Once done, it will restart, and we’ll set a password. Remember, the username and password need to be complex.
When Windows Server loads, press Ctrl+Alt+Del to log in (VirtualBox has a way to send this command without affecting the host system). Enter the password, and the Server Manager dashboard will load. Now, Windows Server is installed.
In Server Manager, you can set up different roles and features. For example, go to Local Server and adjust basic settings like the computer name, IP, remote desktop, Ethernet settings, and time zone.

We’ll continue by configuring Active Directory. First, let’s rename the server, perhaps to "Active Directory" or "Domain Controller." We’ll assign it an internal IP, like 10.11.12.220. After setting the IP, go to the time zone settings (we’ll set it to "Kuwait" or "Riyadh" time zone).
After the restart, log back in with Ctrl+Alt+Del. Go to Dashboard > Roles and Features, then select "Active Directory Domain Services" and add it. This process will take some time, so I’ll pause the video.
Once that’s done, we’ll promote this server to a domain controller by creating a new forest (since this is the first domain) and entering the domain name, such as "quickstore.local." Then, set a password.
After installation, it will restart again. Remember to remove the ISO file. Once Windows Server restarts, login with the domain user credentials.
We’ll now have a dashboard for managing Active Directory. In a future video, we’ll add a client to the domain controller. This concludes our Windows Server and Active Directory setup. Thank you!
